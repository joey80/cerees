# Cerees

Cerees is an app that allows you to search for any tv show and to be able to see all of the ratings for each episode for all of its seasons. This is a pretty nice way of seeing if the show is worth investing your time in and also at what point in time did the quality in the episodes possibly start to tank. On top of episode ratings it also shows you which streaming platforms you can watch the show on.
